# Task 2 – Simple Rule-Based Chatbot

## Overview

This project is a **simple, rule-based internal chatbot** created as part of the KSEYE Junior Software Developer assessment (Task 2 – Option B).

The purpose of this utility is to demonstrate:
- clean, readable, and maintainable code
- basic intent matching and control flow
- sensible handling of unknown or ambiguous input
- how the solution could be extended in the future using an AI API

The chatbot is intentionally **non-AI** and deterministic. This mirrors how a real financial-services organisation might start with simple automation before introducing AI-based enhancements.

## What the Chatbot Does

- Accepts a user question via the command line
- Matches the question to a predefined intent using simple rules (keyword matching)
- Returns an appropriate predefined response
- Handles unknown queries gracefully

Example intents include:
- Requests for lending criteria
- Pricing matrix guidance
- Application status queries
- New starter access queries
- Template letter requests
